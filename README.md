# üìö Bash Utility Scripts: The Toolbox

Welcome to the **Bash Utility Scripts** repository!

This collection is a growing toolbox of modular scripts designed to simplify common tasks across system monitoring, security analysis, and specialized technical fields like applied cryptography.

The goal is to provide **robust**, **quick-to-deploy**, and **easy-to-understand** scripts that enhance efficiency for both daily system operations and deeper technical investigations.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into distinct categories, allowing you to quickly locate the type of tool you need:

| Directory | Focus | Description |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `cybersec` | Network & Credentials | Tools like **Nmap Scanner** for reconnaissance| 
| `SystemTools` | Diagnostics | Scipts for monitoring system health, CPU/Memory usage, disk space, and essential maintenance. |
| `generator` | Generator | **Password Generator** for creating secure credentials and more |

Each directory contains its own dedicated `README.md` file with detailed instructions, usage examples, and parameter definitions for the scripts it holds.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitRaybytes/bashscripts/tree/main
```

2. **Explore:** Navigate to the specific directory corresponding to the tool you wish to use (e.g., `cd tools/cybersec`).

3. **Consult the local README:** Always check the `README.md` file within the subdirectory for specific execution and dependency requirements.

**Happy scripting!**
