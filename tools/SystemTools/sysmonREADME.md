# ðŸ’» System Monitoring Tools

Welcome to the system-tools directory!

This collection contains essential Bash scripts designed to provide quick, human-readable diagnostics on the current operational status and resource utilization of your machine. These tools are indispensable for system administrators and power users needing fast access to core health metrics.

## ðŸ“Š Focus Areas

The scripts in this directory are focused on monitoring critical system components:

- **CPU Usage:** Checking current load, core utilization, and process bottlenecks.
- **Memory (RAM) Health:** Detailed breakdowns of used, free, and cached memory, often displayed as clear percentages and human-readable units (e.g., GB/MB).
- **Disk I/O and Space:** Monitoring available storage and analyzing read/write speeds to diagnose performance issues.
- **Process Management:** Quickly identifying and summarizing resource-intensive processes.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use

Each script within this directory (e.g., `lsProc.sh`, `dynProcCheck.sh`) is built to be modular. Refer to the specific local README.md for each script's usage, parameters (like `seconds` for refresh rates or `count` for process limits), and output formats.
