# üõ°Ô∏è CyberSecurity Tools

Welcome to the cybersecurity-tools directory.

This section contains powerful scripts designed for **network reconnaissance**, **analysis**, and **security testing** (e.g., Nmap wrappers and credential generators).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning: Use Responsibly

The tools in this directory are intended solely for educational purposes, defensive practice, and ethical testing of systems you explicitly own or have permission to analyze.

Do not use these tools to scan, test, or potentially harm any system or network you do not have explicit, written authorization to operate on.

Using these scripts on third-party systems without permission is illegal and unethical. By proceeding, you acknowledge these risks and agree to use these resources responsibly.
